 # Working:
If you have not watched A Beautiful Mind, it is recommended that you do. It is not going to help you with this assignment though (Just a recommendation). A Beautiful Mind is a 2001 American biographical drama film based on the life of John Nash. John Nash was an American mathematician who made fundamental contributions to game theory, differential geometry, and the study of partial differential equations. He also happened to invent the game of Hex which is your first assignment.

Here is a link to the deleted scene from the movie where John Nash comes up with a new Game of Go later known as Hex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTZ3nn2Bge4. Hex is a strategy board game for two players played on a hexagonal grid, theoretically of any size and several possible shapes, but traditionally as an 11Ã—11 rhombus. Players alternate placing markers or stones on unoccupied spaces in an attempt to link their opposite sides of the board in an unbroken chain. One player must win; there are no draws. The game has a deep strategy, sharp tactics and a profound mathematical underpinning related to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem.

                                            ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68895316/120931939-2be71980-c70d-11eb-994e-5e83fac3c736.png)


The main goal of the game is to connect two opposite sides of the board by creating an unbroken chain of hexes. To get a better understanding of the game you can play it here against your friends an AI Player. Here is a link to the game: http://www.lutanho.net/play/hex.html

Features:

    *)- AI player which play intelligent against human player.                                                                                                                       *)- Minimax algorithm is used for AI Player.


# Conclusion:
Main Purpose of this project is to Build a Game of Hex for AI player which play intelligently using Alpha beta pruning.
